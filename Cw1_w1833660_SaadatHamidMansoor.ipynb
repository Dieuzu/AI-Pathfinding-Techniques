        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been an integral part of video games since their inception in the 1950s. In video games, AI is used to generate responsive, adaptive, or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-playable characters (NPCs), similar to human-like intelligence. AI in video games is a distinct subfield and differs from academic AI. It serves to improve the game-player experience rather than machine learning or decision making. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the gaming industry has transformed virtual environments, enhancing player experiences through lifelike behaviors and dynamic content generation (Ian Millington, 2019).\n"

Each ghost followed a distinct rule in chase mode, lending them unique personalities. until the mid 1990's, the field of game AI remained relatively stagnant, with computer-controlled characters resembling the simplicity of Pac-Man ghosts, lacking significant advancements in sophistication.

        "AI, once confined to the realms of enemy character behaviors, has now become an influential force in modern game development. Its influence permeates every aspect of the gaming experience, introducing layers of complexity that enhance the immersive nature of virtual environments. The transformative shift in AI over the past decade is marked by the rise of deep learning, driven not by academic breakthroughs but by the practical application of neural networks, notably empowered by increased computing capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "NPC AI in games primarily serves three fundamental functions: character movement, decision-making on movement, and tactical or strategic thinking, with many diverse approaches converging to meet these common requirements (Ian Millington, 2022). a brief look into some of the most important aspects of AI in games will be listed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pathfinding Algorithms:** \n",
        "Pathfinding is a critical aspect of game AI that enables non-player characters (NPCs) to navigate through the game world. The goal of pathfinding algorithms is to find the most efficient route from point A to point B. At the heart of dynamic character movement lies pathfinding algorithms. A* (A-star), Dijkstra's algorithm, and Depth-First Search (DFS) are the digital pathfinding methods guiding Non Player Characters (NPC) through the virtual realms of games. These algorithms are not just mathematical formulas, they are the foundation of seamless exploration, ensuring that characters traverse diverse landscapes with a natural fluidity while remaining true to their goals and keeping the illusion of immersiveness real. *Figure 2* Showcases how a pathfinding is applied to Enemy NPCs to predict their possible movement outcomes towards the player character. \n",
        "RPG games like Fire Emblem developed by intelligent systems and published by Nintendo has been using Pathfinding algorithms since 1990 in their first release: Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light (1990), and each subsequent game has improved on the AI that handles pathfinding right up to their newest release in 2023 Fire Emblem Engage. The integration of advanced pathfinding algorithms ensures characters navigate challenging terrains seamlessly.\n",

        "2. **Procedural Terrain Generation:** \n",
        "Terrain generation in games refers to the process of creating the game environment or ‘world’. This could include everything from the landscapes and weather systems to the placement of buildings and objects. AI can be used to procedurally generate these terrains, creating unique and dynamic environments for each play through. The locations on which most of the gaming narrative unfolds is no longer static but a living, breathing entity shaped by terrain generation algorithms. Some notable techniques include Perlin noise and cellular automata, similar to virtual sculptors these techniques can craft terrains with jagged mountain ranges, meandering rivers, and sprawling valleys. \n",
        "The result is a dynamic location that responds to the player's every action, creating unique and ever-changing levels of visual splendor filled with exciting and strategic challenges. *Figure 3* showcases how a natural looking terrain can be procedurally generated. Procedural terrain generation, as seen in games like \"Minecraft\" and \"No Man's Sky,\" leads to the creation of vast and diverse landscapes. The result is a dynamic and immersive gaming experience where players can explore unique and procedurally generated worlds.\n",

        "3. **Procedural Content Creation:** \n",
        "Procedural Content Creation (PCC) is a method of creating game content algorithmically rather than manually. In other words, developers create algorithms that generate game content on the fly. This could include anything from level design and object placement to narrative events and dialogue. PCC allows for a vast amount of content to be created with minimal input from developers, making it ideal for open-world games or games with a high degree of replayability. It also ensures that each player’s experience is unique, as the content they encounter will be different each time they play. The storytellers of virtual worlds are no longer bound by predefined narratives. \n",
        "When it comes to AI in games, Procedural Content Creation is a popular area of research. Deep learning methods have been applied to generate game content directly or indirectly, such as levels, maps, character models, and textures 1. AI algorithms can assist in creating game assets, such as textures, 3D models, and animations. This accelerates the development process, allowing designers to focus on more creative aspects while AI handles repetitive tasks. Additionally, AI can help generate questlines, dialogues, and story elements\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Swarm Intelligence:**\n",
        "Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a subfield of AI that studies the collective behavior of decentralized systems like flocks of birds, colonies of ants, and schools of fish. In the context of game AI, SI techniques can be used to create emergent behaviors in large groups of agents, making them appear more natural and unpredictable (Eric Bonabeau et al, 1999). This is achieved by imbuing individual agents with simple rules, leading to complex and unique group dynamics, as observed in realistic crowd behavior or swarming enemies. A key feature is the absence of a central leader; instead, agents communicate and coordinate using local information, making them able to adjust well to different situations. Games like \"Spore\" and \"Skyrim\" employ Swarm Intelligence for lifelike flocking birds, while games like \"Empire Ants\" simulates ant colonies, and the Zerg swarm in \"StarCraft\" showcases emergent behavior for strategic advantage. Overall, Swarm Intelligence in game AI enhances realism and adaptability by harnessing decentralized, emergent principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we explore the various types of AI in games, we uncover not just a technological advancement but a reimagining of the very essence of interactive entertainment. Its safe to say, AI has revolutionized the way we design and play video games. It has allowed for more complex and realistic game worlds, more intelligent and believable NPCs, and a more personalized and dynamic gaming experience. As AI technology continues to advance, we can only expect its role in video game development to grow. \n",

        "Procedural terrain generation is an AI technique used in game development to create realistic and dynamic landscapes. This technique uses algorithms that generate terrain features and details based on predefined rules and parameters. one commonly utilized method within procedural terrain generation is Perlin noise, developed by Ken Perlin.Perlin noise is a gradient noise function that assigns values to points in space, resulting in smoothly varying patterns. In terrain generation, Perlin noise is used to simulate natural randomness, producing convincing landscapes with features like mountains, valleys, and plains. The beauty of Perlin noise lies in its simplicity and versatility. By adjusting parameters such as amplitude and frequency, developers can control the scale and detail of the generated terrain see *Figure 4*. This flexibility makes Perlin noise an ideal choice for creating vast and visually appealing landscapes in games, providing a dynamic and immersive environment for players to explore.\n",
        "The randomness within Perlin noise allows for the creation of terrains that exhibit natural variability, avoiding the regular and artificial look that simplistic algorithms might produce. As a result, game developers use Perlin noise to create realistic, aesthetic and complext terrains their game environments in level design.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the biggest advantage of procedural terrain generation, particularly in level design for video games, is the ability to generate large and diverse environments efficiently. Unlike manually designing each section of a game world, procedural techniques allow developers to create expansive terrains with minimal human intervention. This not only saves time but also enables the generation of unique and varied landscapes for each playthrough, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. Additionally, procedural terrain generation facilitates adaptability and scalability in game development. As the terrain is generated algorithmically, it can be modified on the go to respond to player actions or changing game conditions. This dynamic adaptability adds an element of unpredictability and replayability to games, keeping players engaged with evolving landscapes.\n"

        "In this section, we demonstrated the practical aplication of A* pathfinding adapted for an NPC navigating a procedurally generated terrain. By integrating Perlin noise-based terrain, we introduced a dynamic element to the game environment. The A* algorithm, tailored for terrain, efficiently identified optimal paths through varied terrains of grass, sand, and water. The visualization of the NPC's tracking journey towards the player added a layer of dynamism to the scenario. Leveraging the A* algorithm, the NPC showcased an ability to intelligently traverse the terrain, emphasizing the algorithm's role in enhancing NPC behavior within the game world. This section showcased the practical application of pathfinding algorithms in game development, showcasing their adaptability to complex terrains. See Apendix for Section 3 (extra) which showcases the same technique demonstrated in a Multi NPC game envrionment where Player position is randomly set!"
